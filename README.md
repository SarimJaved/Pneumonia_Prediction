# Pneumonia_Prediction  

Revolutionize healthcare diagnostics with our **Pneumonia Prediction App**, a cutting-edge tool designed to detect pneumonia using advanced deep learning technology. Simply upload a chest X-ray image, and the app predicts with remarkable accuracy whether the patient is affected by pneumonia, aiding in early diagnosis and timely treatment.  

## Detailed Description  

Our **Pneumonia Prediction App** is a machine learning-powered solution developed to assist medical professionals and individuals in detecting pneumonia efficiently. The app is built using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model trained on a diverse dataset of chest X-ray images.  

### Features:  
- **Simple Upload Interface**: Users can easily upload X-ray images to get instant predictions.  
- **Deep Learning Model**: Built with a robust CNN architecture to analyze medical images with high precision.  
- **Early Detection**: Helps in identifying pneumonia at an early stage to ensure timely medical intervention.  
- **User-Friendly**: Accessible and intuitive interface, suitable for both professionals and general users.  

### Dataset  
The model was trained, validated, and tested using a comprehensive dataset of chest X-rays available on Kaggle:  
[**Pneumonia Prediction Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sarimr/pneumonia-prediction-training-testing-validation)  

### How It Works  
1. Upload a chest X-ray image through the app.  
2. The CNN model processes the image and predicts whether pneumonia is present.  
3. Receive instant results to aid in diagnosis and further medical action.  

### Training the Model  
The CNN model was trained using Python with TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The training file, `model_train_cnn.py`, contains the complete code for training the model.  

### Deployment  
The application is deployed using **Flask**, providing a seamless interface to interact with the trained model.  

### Usage  
Clone the repository and follow the steps in the documentation to set up the app locally. For more details, refer to the `README.md` file included in the repository.
